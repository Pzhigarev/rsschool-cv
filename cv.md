## About Myself: 


**I started my journey in May of this year. Since then, I have attended software testing courses and various webinars on development. Having decided on the direction, I began to study JS.**
**I was fascinated by it and absorbed the information every day. I have set high goals for myself and I am gradually achieving them. Every day there is more and more knowledge.**
**Now I am sure that I will achieve my goal. I quite easily perceive new information, which gives me faith in success.**


**I started my training with learn.javascript.ru , after which I got into the School where I am currently studying.
In addition, I participate in all webinars related to JS.**


**I am also diligent, scrupulous, focused, and my main goal is the result!**
